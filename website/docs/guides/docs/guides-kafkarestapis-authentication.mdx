## Token verification

Users can access the system or service without providing any explicit identification credentials like identity card and cell-phone number. Users generate an Ethereum private key to create a **token** (which is kind of digital signature of a specific message) as authenticity. The proxy that needs to validate the user's authenticity which can verify the token using the user's public key. If the token is valid, it proves that the user possesses the private key corresponding to the public key used for verification.
