- Install **yarn**: https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install
- Clone this repo: **git clone https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.git**

## Starting RocketChat
To install all dependency libraries by yarn command,

yarn
```
It will take long time to build porject with yarn dsv command.
```bash
yarn dsv # run only meteor (front and back) with pre-built packages
```
If server runing info showed in the shell, it means build and run the RocketChat Server successfully.

To access this section, go to Administration > Workspace > Settings > Logs.

- Log Exceptions to Channel: Set a channel to receive all captured exceptions. Leave empty to ignore exceptions.

- Log Level: A dropdown to select the level of logs to receive

- Log View Limit: The limit of logs to view

- Trace method calls: When enabled, it enables a trace of every method call.

- Trace method filter: The text here is evaluated as RegExp (new RegExp('text')). Keep it empty to show a trace of every call.

- Trace subscription calls: If enabled, every subscription call will be traced.

- Trace subscription filter: The text here is evaluated as RegExp (new RegExp('text')). Keep it empty to show a trace of every call.
