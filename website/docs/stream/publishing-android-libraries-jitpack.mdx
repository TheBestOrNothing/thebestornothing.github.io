# Publish Android libs to Jitpack

:::info[Useful links]

[`Publishing Android libraries to Jitpack`](https://jitpack.io/) https://jitpack.io/

:::

Creating a great library is hard work. Coming up with the idea, implementing it, making sure you have a nice, stable public API that you control carefully and maintain… That’s already lots to do.

After all that, you need to make your library available to the public. Technically, you could distribute the .aar file any way you want, but the norm is publishing it to a publicly available Maven repository. It’s a good idea to use one of the well-established repositories that people are already likely to have in their projects, to make getting started with your library as easy as possible.

The simplest choice would be [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/), which is very easy to get started with. All you have to do is publish your project on GitHub, and JitPack should be able to build and distribute it immediately. If you’re new to libraries, this is a great choice for getting your code out there.


## Release configuration

The signing is madetory for jitpack, so the keyId, key and password is not requried. So the publish-module.gradle is useful for jitpack and nexus publishing.

```js title="scripts/publish-module.gradle"
apply plugin: 'maven-publish'
apply plugin: 'signing'
apply plugin: 'org.jetbrains.dokka'

tasks.register('androidSourcesJar', Jar) {
    archiveClassifier.set('sources')
    if (project.plugins.findPlugin("com.android.library")) {
        from android.sourceSets.main.java.srcDirs
        from android.sourceSets.main.kotlin.srcDirs
    } else {
        from sourceSets.main.java.srcDirs
        from sourceSets.main.kotlin.srcDirs
    }
}

tasks.withType(dokkaHtmlPartial.getClass()).configureEach {
    pluginsMapConfiguration.set(
            ["org.jetbrains.dokka.base.DokkaBase": """{ "separateInheritedMembers": true}"""]
    )
}

task javadocJar(type: Jar, dependsOn: dokkaJavadoc) {
    archiveClassifier.set('javadoc')
    from dokkaJavadoc.outputDirectory
}

artifacts {
    archives androidSourcesJar
    archives javadocJar
}

group = PUBLISH_GROUP_ID
version = PUBLISH_VERSION

afterEvaluate {
    publishing {
        publications {
            release(MavenPublication) {
                tasks.named("generateMetadataFileForReleasePublication").configure { dependsOn("androidSourcesJar") }
                groupId PUBLISH_GROUP_ID
                artifactId PUBLISH_ARTIFACT_ID
                version PUBLISH_VERSION
                if (project.plugins.findPlugin("com.android.library")) {
                    from components.release
                } else {
                    from components.java
                }

                artifact javadocJar

                pom {
                    name = PUBLISH_ARTIFACT_ID
                    description = 'Stream Chat official Android SDK'

                    licenses {
                        license {

                            url = 'https://github.com/thebestornothing/stream-chat-android/blob/main/LICENSE'
                        }
                    }
                    developers {
                        developer {
                            id = 'leandroBorgesFerreira'
                            name = 'Leandro Borges Ferreira'
                            email = 'leandro@getstream.io'
                        }
                        developer {
                            id = 'bychkovdmitry'
                            name = 'Dmitrii Bychkov'
                            email = 'dmitrii@getstream.io'
                        }
                    }
                    scm {
                        connection = 'scm:git:github.com/thebestornothing/stream-chat-android.git'
                        developerConnection = 'scm:git:ssh://github.com/thebestornothing/stream-chat-android.git'
                        url = 'https://github.com/thebestornothing/stream-chat-android/tree/main'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

// For signing you need to make signingKey and signingPassword available properties
// SIGNING_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SIGNING_PASSWORD }}
// SIGNING_KEY: ${{ secrets.SIGNING_KEY }}
// After making the github action secrets above available, you can try publish in the github workflow
// ./gradlew signMavenPublication
//
def hasSigningKey = rootProject.ext["signing.keyId"] || rootProject.ext["signing.key"]
if(hasSigningKey) {
    sign(project)
}
void sign(Project project) {
    project.signing {
        required { project.gradle.taskGraph.hasTask("publish") }
        def signingKeyId = rootProject.ext["signing.keyId"]
        def signingKey = rootProject.ext["signing.key"]
        def signingPassword = rootProject.ext["signing.password"]
        if (signingKeyId) {
            useInMemoryPgpKeys(signingKeyId, signingKey, signingPassword)
        } else if (signingKey) {
            useInMemoryPgpKeys(signingKey, signingPassword)
        }
        sign publishing.publications
    }
}
```

## Version configuraiton

Finally see the group ID, artifact ID, and version being set, so that the publication script can make use of them. Then, the script itself is applied. This is all the code you need to add per-module if you are publishing your library in multiple artifacts, everything else is done by the common script.
```js title="buildSrc/Configuration.kt"
object Configuration {
    const val compileSdk = 34
    const val targetSdk = 34
    const val sampleTargetSdk = 34
    const val minSdk = 21
    const val majorVersion = 6
    const val minorVersion = 0
    const val patchVersion = 8
    const val myVersion = 2
    const val versionName = "$majorVersion.$minorVersion.$patchVersion.$myVersion"
    const val snapshotVersionName = "$majorVersion.$minorVersion.${patchVersion + 1}-SNAPSHOT"
    const val artifactGroup = "io.gitcoins"
}
```

## Github Action integration
Since the library is hosted on GitHub anyway, we use GitHub Actions for running the publication Gradle tasks automatically. Whatever CI solution you’re using, setting up publication with it will consist of two main steps:
- Getting your secret variables in place.
- Invoking the two Gradle tasks.

Your secret variables - for the list of these, look at the publishing script again - can simply go into Repository secrets (Add each of these by going to Settings -> Secrets within your GitHub repository). All the variables will be show in the [Actions secrets and variables](https://github.com/TheBestOrNothing/stream-chat-android/settings/secrets/actions).

Now, let’s create the GitHub Actions workflow that will put all of this together. The configuration for this will go in the .github/workflows/publish.yml file of the repository. This publish workflow will run every time a new release is created in the repository (you can also change the triggers to run when a tag is created, for example).

```js title="workflows/publish-my.yml"
name: PublishGitcoins

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+'

jobs:
  publish:
    name: Release build and publish beta
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3.1.0
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3.6.0
        with:
          distribution: adopt
          java-version: 17
      - name: Release build
        # assembleRelease for all modules, excluding non-library modules: samples, docs
        run: ./gradlew assembleRelease -x :stream-chat-android-ui-components-sample:assembleRelease -x :stream-chat-android-compose-sample:assembleRelease -x :stream-chat-android-docs:assembleRelease
      - name: Source jar and dokka
        run: ./gradlew androidSourcesJar javadocJar
      - name: Publish to MavenCentral
        run: ./gradlew publishReleasePublicationToSonatypeRepository --max-workers 1 closeAndReleaseSonatypeStagingRepository
        env:
          OSSRH_TOKEN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.OSSRH_TOKEN_USERNAME }}
          OSSRH_TOKEN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.OSSRH_TOKEN_PASSWORD }}
          SIGNING_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SIGNING_PASSWORD }}
          SIGNING_KEY: ${{ secrets.SIGNING_KEY }}
          SONATYPE_STAGING_PROFILE_ID: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_STAGING_PROFILE_ID }}
```

## Your first release

After adapt the code of [stream-chat-android](https://github.com/TheBestOrNothing/stream-chat-android) and create new tag like v6.0.8-beta16, the workflow action will be triggered.

```shell
git tag -a v6.0.8-beta16 -m "v6.0.8.2 publish"
git push origin v6.0.8-beta16
```
Go to [action page](https://github.com/TheBestOrNothing/stream-chat-android/actions) in the repository, lookup the detailed info in the running workflow. After the workflow run successfully, go to the [Nexus Repository Manager](https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/#stagingProfiles;638cedd9d39c2) and in the menu on the left, select Staging repositories.Search or find your repository (search gitcoins in the Artifact Search), which has your group ID in its name. If you select it and look at the Content tab, you’ll see the files that have been published.

## Using the publish library

### Create new Project in Android studio

To get started with the Jetpack Compose version of the Android Chat SDK, open Android Studio (Giraffe or newer) and create a new project.

- Select the Empty Activity template
- Name the project ChatTutorial
- Set the package name to com.example.chattutorial

### Add Stream Chat Compose SDK
Let's add the Stream Chat Compose SDK to the project's dependencies. **io.gitcoins:stream-chat-android-compose:6.0.8.2** and **io.gitcoins:stream-chat-android-offline:6.0.8.2** are coming from Nexus Repository which have been published according to this guide.

```js title="build.gradle"
dependencies {

    implementation("io.gitcoins:stream-chat-android-compose:6.0.8.2")
    implementation("io.gitcoins:stream-chat-android-ui-utils:6.0.8.2")
    implementation("io.gitcoins:stream-chat-android-offline:6.0.8.2")

    //implementation("io.getstream:stream-chat-android-compose:6.0.8")
    //implementation("io.getstream:stream-chat-android-offline:6.0.8")
}
```
