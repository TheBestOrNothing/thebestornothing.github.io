# Connect to MetaMask-GPT

You can connect to MetaMask-GPT by scanning MetaMask QRcode in chatGPT client and then connecting to your accounts.

The MetaMask-GPT authorization code flow allows chatGPT client to obtain access tokens to access protected resources like web APIs.
It starts with the prompts directing the user to the authorization server, where the user authenticates and consents.
The server returns an authorization code to the client, which the client exchanges for an access token.
