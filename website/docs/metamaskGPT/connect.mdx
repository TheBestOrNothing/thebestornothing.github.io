# Connect to MetaMask-GPT

You can connect to MetaMask-GPT by scanning MetaMask QRcode in chatGPT client and then connecting to your accounts.

The MetaMask-GPT authorization code flow allows chatGPT client to obtain access tokens to access protected resources like getting selected accounts.
It starts with the prompts directing the user to the MetaMask-GPT authorization server, where the user authenticates and consents.
The MetaMask-GPT authorization server returns an authorization code to the client, which the client exchanges for an access token.

## Connect to MetaMask-GPT using prompts

```bash title="Prompts"
Goal: Establish a connection between the user’s MetaMask account and the GPT client, retrieve the MetaMask authorization code and QR code, generate a MetaMask token, and access the selected account.
1. Request MetaMask Authorization: request the MetaMask authorization code and MetaMask QR code from the GPT client to initiate the connection to MetaMask via the authorization server.
2. Retrieve Authorization Code & QR Code: once access to the authorization server is successful, retrieve the MetaMask authorization code and generate the MetaMask QR code.
3. Prompt for QR Code Scanning: ask the user: "Have you scanned the MetaMask QR code to connect your account?" 
4. Retrieve MetaMask Token: If the user responds Yes, proceed by exchanging the MetaMask authorization code for a MetaMask token.
5. Get Selected Account: Retrieve the user’s selected MetaMask account from the MetaMask mobile app.
```
:::tip
The prompts of connecting to MetaMask-GPT are improved by [Prompt Engineer GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-5XtVuRE8Y-prompt-engineer). This GPT let you become a pro prompt engineer, by learning and applying best prompt practices.

## Flow of MetaMask-GPT connection
The MetaMask authorization code flow is described in the following. chatGPT client using theMetaMask authorization code flow acquire an access_token to include in requests to resources protected by the MetaMask-GPT identity platform (typically APIs). **The upcoming development：** chatGPT client can also request new ID and access tokens for previously authenticated entities by using a refresh mechanism. This diagram shows a high-level view of the authentication flow:

    participant MetaMaskMobile as MetaMask Mobile

    chatGPTClient->>MetaMask-GPTAuthServer: To request an authorization code using prompts
    MetaMask-GPTAuthServer->>chatGPTClient: Return the code and QRcode
    MetaMaskMobile->>MetaMaskMobile: Scan the QRcode 
    MetaMask-GPTAuthServer->>MetaMaskMobile: Request of connect accounts 
    MetaMaskMobile->>MetaMask-GPTAuthServer: Accounts connected
    chatGPTClient->>MetaMask-GPTAuthServer: Request of access_token with authorization code
    MetaMask-GPTAuthServer->>MetaMaskMobile: Request of sign for access_token 
    MetaMaskMobile->>MetaMask-GPTAuthServer: Return sign for access_token 
    MetaMask-GPTAuthServer->>chatGPTClient: Sign, account, expired time composed as access_token
    note over chatGPTClient, MetaMaskMobile: Now that you have successfully acquired an access_token, you can use the token in requests to web APIs by including it in the Authorization header.
