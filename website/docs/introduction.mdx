# Introduction
To create an **anonymous**, **privacy-focused**, and **untraceable** environment, We are building a platform named "WoofWoof".
WoofWoof is anonymous, end-to-end cryptography distributed event streaming platform based on Kafka. 


## Design principles {#design-principles}

- **Privacy protection**. Encrypting sensitive information helps secure it from unauthorized access. This includes encrypting data in transit (during communication) and data at rest (when stored). Preventing the creation of detailed UserProfile of individual users based on their activities, behaviors, or personal information.
- **Untraceable **. Transactions and message made with crypto can be challenging to link to specific individuals. The sender and recipient of a message cannot be easily identified or located. Tracking would be difficult, complex, or highly obscured. 
- **Made Easy**. Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable modules. Use clear and understandable abstractions to hide unnecessary details. Tools like Docker can simplify deployment by encapsulating applications and their dependencies. 
- **Collaboration**. No licensing to prevent users from using the software for various purposes. Encourage collaboration not only to develop software, but also to build untraceable and privacy protection environment.

We believe that, as developers, knowing how a library works helps us become better at using it. Hence we're dedicating effort to explaining the architecture and various components of Docusaurus with the hope that users reading it will gain a deeper understanding of the tool and be even more proficient in using it.

## Comparison with other tools {#comparison-with-other-tools}

Across all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on documentation sites and has many out-of-the-box features.

We've also studied other main static site generators and would like to share our insights on the comparison, hopefully helping you navigate through the prismatic choices out there.

### Gatsby {#gatsby}

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is packed with a lot of features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins, and is capable of doing everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that comes at a cost of a higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for building many types of websites. On the other hand, Docusaurus tries to do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing content.

GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don't necessarily need GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static websites, you won't need the flexibility that GraphQL provides.

Many aspects of Docusaurus v2+ were inspired by the best things about Gatsby and it's a great alternative.

[Docz](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz) is a Gatsby theme to build documentation websites. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus.

### Next.js {#nextjs}

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is another very popular hybrid React framework. It can help you build a good documentation website, but it is not opinionated toward the documentation use-case, and it will require a lot more work to implement what Docusaurus provides out-of-the-box.

[Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) is an opinionated static site generator built on top of Next.js. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus.

### VuePress {#vuepress}

[VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) has many similarities with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric website and provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VuePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VuePress would be a decent choice.

### MkDocs {#mkdocs}

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a popular Python static site generator with value propositions similar to Docusaurus.

It is a good option if you don't need a single-page application and don't plan to leverage React.

[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is a beautiful theme.

### Docsify {#docsify}

[Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) makes it easy to create a documentation website, but is not a static-site generator and is not SEO friendly.

### GitBook {#gitbook}

[GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) has a very clean design and has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs of open source projects' documentation sites. As a result, many have turned to other products. You may read about Redux's switch to Docusaurus [here](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/3161).

Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams. Docusaurus is free for everyone.

### Jekyll {#jekyll}

[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) is one of the most mature static site generators around and has been a great tool to use â€” in fact, before Docusaurus, most of Facebook's Open Source websites are/were built on Jekyll! It is extremely simple to get started. We want to bring a similar developer experience as building a static site with Jekyll.

In comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added using `<script />` tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps. Using modern JavaScript ecosystem tooling, we hope to set new standards on doc sites' performance, asset building pipeline and optimizations, and ease to set up.

## Something missing? {#something-missing}

If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please [file an issue](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) for us, or send a tweet mentioning the [@docusaurus](https://twitter.com/docusaurus) Twitter account.

For new feature requests, you can create a post on our [feature requests board (Canny)](/feature-requests), which is a handy tool for road-mapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!
