# Docus Tips

## Tagging a new version {#tagging-a-new-version}

1. First, make sure the current docs version (the `./docs` directory) is ready to be frozen.
2. Enter a new version number.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run docusaurus docs:version 1.1.0
```

When tagging a new version, the document versioning mechanism will:

- Copy the full `docs/` folder contents into a new `versioned_docs/version-[versionName]/` folder.
- Create a versioned sidebars file based from your current configuration (if it exists) - saved as `versioned_sidebars/version-[versionName]-sidebars.json`.
- Append the new version number to `versions.json`.

## Creating new docs {#creating-new-docs}

1. Place the new file into the corresponding version folder.
2. Include the reference to the new file in the corresponding sidebar file according to the version number.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Current version structure">
```

```bash
# The new file.
docs/new.md

# Edit the corresponding sidebar file.
sidebars.js
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Older version structure">
```

```bash
# The new file.
versioned_docs/version-1.0.0/new.md

# Edit the corresponding sidebar file.
versioned_sidebars/version-1.0.0-sidebars.json
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Configuring versioning behavior {#configuring-versioning-behavior}

The "current" version is the version name for the `./docs` folder. There are different ways to manage versioning, but two very common patterns are:

- You release v1, and start immediately working on v2 (including its docs). In this case, the **current version** is v2, which is in the `./docs` source folder, and can be browsed at `example.com/docs/next`. The **latest version** is v1, which is in the `./versioned_docs/version-1` source folder, and is browsed by most of your users at `example.com/docs`.
- You release v1, and will maintain it for some time before thinking about v2. In this case, the **current version** and **latest version** will both be point to v1, since the v2 docs doesn't even exist yet!

Docusaurus defaults work great for the first use case. We will label the current version as "next" and you can even choose not to publish it.

**For the 2nd use case**: if you release v1 and don't plan to work on v2 anytime soon, instead of versioning v1 and having to maintain the docs in 2 folders (`./docs` + `./versioned_docs/version-1.0.0`), you may consider "pretending" that the current version is a cut version by giving it a path and a label:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
export default {
  presets: [
    '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
    docs: {
      // highlight-start
      lastVersion: 'current',
      versions: {
        current: {
          label: '1.0.0',
          path: '1.0.0',
        },
      },
      // highlight-end
    },
  ],
};
```

The docs in `./docs` will be served at `/docs/1.0.0` instead of `/docs/next`, and `1.0.0` will become the default version we link to in the navbar dropdown, and you will only need to maintain a single `./docs` folder.

See [Configuring versioning behavior](https://vulnsystem.github.io/docs/3.0.0/versioning#configuring-versioning-behavior) for more details.

## Understanding sidebar association {#sidebar-association}

Following the example above, if a `commonDoc` is included in both sidebars:

```js title="sidebars.js"
export default {
  tutorialSidebar: {
    'Category A': ['doc1', 'doc2', 'commonDoc'],
  },
  apiSidebar: ['doc3', 'doc4', 'commonDoc'],
};
```

How does Docusaurus know which sidebar to display when browsing `commonDoc`? Answer: it doesn't, and we don't guarantee which sidebar it will pick.

When you add doc Y to sidebar X, it creates a two-way binding: sidebar X contains a link to doc Y, and when browsing doc Y, sidebar X will be displayed. But sometimes, we want to break either implicit binding:

1. _How do I generate a link to doc Y in sidebar X without making sidebar X displayed on Y?_ For example, when I include doc Y in multiple sidebars as in the example above, and I want to explicitly tell Docusaurus to display one sidebar?
2. _How do I make sidebar X displayed when browsing doc Y, but sidebar X shouldn't contain the link to Y?_ For example, when Y is a "doc home page" and the sidebar is purely used for navigation?

Front matter option `displayed_sidebar` will forcibly set the sidebar association. For the same example, you can still use doc shorthands without any special configuration:

```js title="sidebars.js"
export default {
  tutorialSidebar: {
    'Category A': ['doc1', 'doc2'],
  },
  apiSidebar: ['doc3', 'doc4'],
};
```

And then add a front matter:

```md title="commonDoc.md"
---
displayed_sidebar: apiSidebar
---
```

Which explicitly tells Docusaurus to display `apiSidebar` when browsing `commonDoc`. Using the same method, you can make sidebar X which doesn't contain doc Y appear on doc Y:

```md title="home.md"
---
displayed_sidebar: tutorialSidebar
---
```

Even when `tutorialSidebar` doesn't contain a link to `home`, it will still be displayed when viewing `home`.

If you set `displayed_sidebar: null`, no sidebar will be displayed whatsoever on this page, and subsequently, no pagination either.
